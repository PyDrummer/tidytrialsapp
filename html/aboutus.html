    <h2>Klace</h2>
    <p>I'm currently a bicycle mechanic making a transition into the tech world. I've got a background in the cycling industry where I've been just a regular ol' sales guy to store manager, and my favorite job so far - guy in the back fixing bikes. I also have a background in the Air Force as a munitions tech. My hope is to bring my weird assortment of skills to a yummy little tech job.</p>

    <h2>Matt</h2>
    <p>My name is Matthew Holder. I was in the Navy for 4 years where I maintained firearms and trained others to use and maintain them. I also held a position in which I was responsible for watching my teams perimeter in order to keep us safe while they transferred equipment and personnel from ship to shore and shore to ship. I am now working to become the best software engineer I can and I will soon be searching for positions in robotics and AI engineering.</p>
