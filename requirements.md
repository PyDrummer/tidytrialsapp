# what will your project do

- Our app allows our user to select a chore and how many times that they do this chore during the week. Each chore is worth a certain amount of chore points! More nasty chores will gain more points.

- The user will have weekly and monthly goals based around getting these chores done. They will have progress bar/avatar and each chore will be a "mile-stone".
We would like to make it so mutliple users can use this at the same time, creating competitons.

- The pain point that this app will solve is who has to do which chores because now you dont get a choice. For the most past its going to be randomly assigned. Getting crappy chores assigned to you all the time will be fixed with our chore weight scale.



- You should care about this product because this will solve the age old question of "who did chores this week". Family members, room mates, college students, cleaning professionals can all uses this as a score card to know who has done what around the house/business.


# What will your project not do
- no way to verify if the chores were actually done or who did them.
- will not do chores for you


# MVP/functional req.

 The user can build a list of their chores, customize the points earned from each. The user can see the chores list and check that they are complete. They will see the points gained and how close they are to the goal.

# Stretch Goals

- being able to add users
- giving one user an admin role
- Custimization page
- user can update their information
